      "description": "Design is full of laws, principles and methodologies that only seem to confuse and bamboozle. Gestalt, double-diamond, skeuomorphism, heuristics, moiré. The list goes on. Sometimes it feels like you need a dictionary when talking to a designer. Join Tom, as he takes us through practical design tactics that you can apply to elevate your projects from functional to fantastic. Whether you're polishing UI elements or overhauling user experiences, you'll leave with insider knowledge you can start using tomorrow. Perfect for developers looking to add a dash of design to their toolkit."

      "description": "There are many different tools and JavaScript libraries for internationalizing websites, but type safety is often an afterthought. This talk presents the unique approach taken by the web team at Unsplash—utilizing types to enforce correctness—including a look at intlc, a compiler which converts ICU Messages into TypeScript functions."
